  - Why we do all this: 
    a) creating objective, repeatable insights 
    b) Create actions: propensity, churn scores, email filters,... 
  - What we need: data in quantity and quality.
    - show impact of data quality : tunable 
    - show learning curve: infliuence of data size 
    - IT view: packages, environments, link to data sources, anonymization
  - What are future trends:
    - fairness
    - GDPR compliance and data lineage
    - agile data incorporation: new sources and formats.
